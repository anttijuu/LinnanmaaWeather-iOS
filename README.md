# Linnanmaa Weather app

> Please note that the weather service the app uses at [weather.willab.fi](http://weather.willab.fi) has been broken for a while. The JSON requests the app makes are not fulfilled anymore. The app launches but receives an error from the server. It seems that the JSON/XML APIs are no longer supported.

This app is meant to demonstrate (in a simple way) how to localize an app in an iOS project.

App has English development language and localization files for Finnish and Swedish.
